## IF LUA'S DONT LOAD 
the libs for luas are in the folder named "gamesense" Just put that folder here   C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive

## For injector!

Compile in release x86, launch injector with admin rights

## Thanks @kitiroo for the help in getting me the gamesense libs
