1. download extreme injector

2. put -insecure in csgo params

3. run steam

4. inject steam_mdule.dll into steam.exe

5. Run csgo.exe

6. inject skeet.dll into csgo.exe

7. the libs for luas are in the folder named "gamesense" Just put that folder here   C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive

Thanks @kitiroo for the help in getting me the gamesense libs 


For injector!

skeet.dll needs to be in the folder with the injector.
Compile in release x86, launch injector with admin rights
